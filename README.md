# 2018-MVA

Minimum Viable Autonomous in multiple languages to help all 2018 FRC teams at least cross the auto line.  FIRSTÂ® POWER UP<sup>SM</sup> awards alliances a ranking point only if all three alliance robots drive past the auto line during the autonomous period.  Since the entire alliance benefits from all robots moving in autonomous, we consider it beneficial to freely distribute example code to enable simple autonomous motion for all robots.

The goal of this project is that no robot should be stationary in autonomous mode.

Good luck to all teams!

## Using This Software

If you would like to use this software for your team or to help another team, please download the project and follow the instructions as provided in the language-specific directory readme.

If you have trouble using the software, you may open an issue and someone will assist you as soon as possible.

## Contributing

To add a new language, please add a directory named the language name with a code file and a README.md file.  The code file should contain all the necessary code to drive past the auto line at a managable speed (probably ~50% power for ~5 seconds) and stop at the beginning of the autonomous period.  Please include information on how to integrate the example code in the readme file.  If you use any placeholder values in the example code, they should be explained in the readme as well.

All example code can assume the stock robot code distributed to all teams as a starting point.

Above all, thank you for your contributions!
